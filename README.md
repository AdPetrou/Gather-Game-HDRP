# Gather-Game-HDRP

Mostly a learning project, 

started out trying to recreate a New World gathering system but it has evolved
into a rabbit hole of Scriptable Objects, Editor Tools and proper Coding Practices.

This code has been rewritten and refactored A LOT but it's taught me a lot about Unity
it's not complete by any means, I chip away at it when I am in the mood to tackle a big project.

The code is more complicated than you would realise if you hit play, I have a fully working 
Scriptable Object Finite State Machine system, Incredibly over-optimised timers and raycasts using 
the new Jobs system and have experimented with the new UIXML trees.

Overall I hope this project will show my skill as a Unity Developer.
